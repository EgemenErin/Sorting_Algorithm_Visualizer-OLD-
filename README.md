# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

This project visualizes sorting algorithms using Tkinter. Currently, it supports Bubble Sort and allows users to generate random data sets for sorting. The application provides a graphical interface to observe the sorting process in real-time.

## Features

- Visualize Bubble Sort algorithm
- Generate random data sets
- Adjustable sorting speed
- Customizable data size and value range

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. This project uses the `tkinter` library, which comes pre-installed with Python.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualization.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd sorting-visualization
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python main.py
```

### File Structure

- `main.py`: The main file containing the Tkinter application.
- `bubbleSort.py`: Contains the Bubble Sort algorithm with visualization callbacks.

## Usage

1. **Algorithm Selection**: Select the sorting algorithm (currently only Bubble Sort is available) from the dropdown menu.
2. **Adjust Speed**: Use the speed slider to adjust the speed of the sorting visualization.
3. **Set Data Size and Value Range**: Use the sliders to set the data size and the minimum and maximum values of the data set.
4. **Generate Data**: Click the "Generate" button to create a new random data set.
5. **Start Sorting**: Click the "Start" button to begin the sorting process.
